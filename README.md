Code and data for manuscript "evolution of territoriality in odonates: a phylogenetic anaylsis".

Files starting with "clean" are the final versions of the code.

File "Clean_Ancestral_state_recon_Code.R" has code for analysis of discreet character models, phylogenetic signal of territoriality and predictor traits, 
estimations of the ancestral state of territoriality, and stochastic character mapping.

File "Clean_testing_correlations.R" has code for associations between binary traits (Pagle94 models) and non-binary traits (phylogenetic logistic regression) 
and Fisher's exact test for collinearity between predictor variables.

The trait "perching behaviour" in the manuscript is coded as "fly_v_perch" to reference the categories fliers and perchers. 

The final dataset is titled "data_vfinal.csv".
